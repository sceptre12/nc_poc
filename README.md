# Monorepo Management Exploration

This NX-based monorepo is designed to test and showcase different theories and approaches to monorepo management. It combines package-based and integrated project structures to demonstrate various architectural patterns and tools.

## Project Structure

### Packages
- **Rsbuild**: Exploring Rsbuild capabilities within a monorepo context.
- **Modern JS**: Testing Modern JS integration in a package-based setup.

### Apps
- **Remote1**: A module federated React app functioning as a remote using Webpack.

## Current Focus Areas

1. **Zephyr Cloud Integration**: 
   - Currently testing Zephyr Cloud (https://www.zephyr-cloud.io/) with Rsbuild.
   - Note: Zephyr integration with Modern JS is in progress by the Zephyr team.

2. **Planned Additions**:
   - **Husky**: For automated linting and test execution on PR pushes.
   - **Docker**: To ensure consistent development environments across the team.

## Goals

1. Explore and compare different monorepo management strategies.
2. Evaluate the integration of various tools and frameworks within a monorepo structure.
3. Optimize development workflow and ensure consistency across projects.

## Future Enhancements

- Further integration of NX features across projects.
- Expansion of module federation examples.
- Implementation of comprehensive CI/CD pipelines.



With this POC I'm laying out all of the tooling for setting up users dev environment when working within the monorepo.

# Get Started
1. Pull down the repo
2. Ensure you have node 20+
3. Ensure you have pnpm (Install Link)[https://pnpm.io/installation]
4. Inside of the nx_poc folder execute: `pnpm i`

## How to launch projects:

### Rsbuild Project




[Learn more about this workspace setup and its capabilities](https://nx.dev/getting-started/tutorials/npm-workspaces-tutorial?utm_source=nx_project&amp;utm_medium=readme&amp;utm_campaign=nx_projects) or run `npx nx graph` to visually explore what was created. Now, let's get you up to speed!

## Run tasks

To run tasks with Nx use:

```sh
npx nx <target> <project-name>
```

For example:

```sh
npx nx build myproject
```

These targets are either [inferred automatically](https://nx.dev/concepts/inferred-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) or defined in the `project.json` or `package.json` files.

[More about running tasks in the docs &raquo;](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)

## Versioning and releasing

To version and release the library use

```
npx nx release
```

Pass `--dry-run` to see what would happen without actually releasing the library.

## Add new projects

While you could add new projects to your workspace manually, you might want to leverage [Nx plugins](https://nx.dev/concepts/nx-plugins?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) and their [code generation](https://nx.dev/features/generate-code?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) feature.

To install a new plugin you can use the `nx add` command. Here's an example of adding the React plugin:
```sh
npx nx add @nx/react
```

Use the plugin's generator to create new projects. For example, to create a new React app or library:

```sh
# Genenerate an app
npx nx g @nx/react:app demo

# Generate a library
npx nx g @nx/react:lib some-lib
```

You can use `npx nx list` to get a list of installed plugins. Then, run `npx nx list <plugin-name>` to learn about more specific capabilities of a particular plugin. Alternatively, [install Nx Console](https://nx.dev/getting-started/editor-setup?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) to browse plugins and generators in your IDE.

## Install Nx Console

Nx Console is an editor extension that enriches your developer experience. It lets you run tasks, generate code, and improves code autocompletion in your IDE. It is available for VSCode and IntelliJ.
